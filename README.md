There are two ways in which you can build and run the web app:

* Build once for (ready for ***Production***):
  * `$ npm run build`
  * Open `build/index.html` through the local webserver


* Hot reloading via webpack dev server:
  * `$ npm start`
  * Point your browser to http://localhost:3000/, page hot reloads automatically when there are changes

## Testing

To execute all unit tests, use:

```sh
npm run test
```

To run unit tests continuously during development (watch tests), use:

```sh
npm run test:watch
```
